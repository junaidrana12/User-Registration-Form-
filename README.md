# User-Registration-Form

## 🌿 Spring Boot Thymeleaf Form Handling Project
This is a simple web application built using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf to demonstrate how form handling works in a Spring MVC environment.

The application allows users to fill out a registration form, submit their details, and view a success page with the submitted information.

The core idea of the project is to help developers understand:

How to design forms using Thymeleaf syntax (th:action, th:object, th:field, etc.)

How to bind form data to a Java model using Spring’s @ModelAttribute

How to handle GET and POST requests in a Spring controller

How to display submitted data on a success page

The example used is a User Registration Form, where the user fills in details like name, email, gender, and hobbies. After submission, the entered data is displayed on a response page confirming successful submission.

This project is a great starting point for anyone learning Spring MVC, form validation, and server-side rendering with Thymeleaf.
